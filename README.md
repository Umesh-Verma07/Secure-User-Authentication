# Secure-User-Authentication
This project is a user authentication webpage. It is being developed as part of an internship at Future Intern.

This project implements a secure user authentication system with the following features: <br>
**User Registration and Login:** Users can sign up for an account and log in securely using their credentials. <br>
**Authentication and Authorization:** Access to protected routes is granted only after successful authentication.<br>
**Password Security:** Passwords are securely hashed using standard mechanisms to protect user data. <br>
**Session Management:** User sessions are managed to ensure security throughout the interaction. <br>
**Role-Based Access Control:** Access to specific functionalities is restricted based on user roles. <br>
**Protected Routes:** Sensitive functionalities are protected, allowing only authorized users to access them. <br>
This system ensures robust security practices, restricting unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the application.
